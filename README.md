# decentralised lending

## ðŸ“Œ Project Description

**decentralised lending** is a simple yet effective smart contract-based solution that enables borrowers to request loans directly on the Ethereum blockchain and repay them with a predefined interest. The system aims to eliminate intermediaries by providing a trustless lending mechanism.

## ðŸŒŸ Project Vision

To democratize finance by allowing anyone to lend and borrow funds in a decentralized and transparent manner using blockchain technology, thus removing the need for centralized financial institutions.

## âœ¨ Key Features

- **Loan Requesting**: Users can request loans by sending ETH and setting repayment terms.
- **Repayment Tracking**: Borrowers can repay loans along with interest, which is then transferred to the contract owner (or lender).
- **Transparency**: All loan data is stored on-chain and accessible for audit.

## ðŸš€ Future Scope

- Enable peer-to-peer lending (multiple lenders and borrowers).
- Add ERC20 token support for loans and repayments.
- Incorporate credit scoring or reputation systems for borrowers.
- Integration with DeFi aggregators and platforms.
- Develop frontend DApp for user-friendly interaction.
